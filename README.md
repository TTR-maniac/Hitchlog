[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flov/Hitchlog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flov/Hitchlog)

The hitchlog is a **social network for hitchhikers**.
By gathering data about what hitchhiking it tries to show a real
picture about hitchhiking representing real data.

Furthermore it brings together hitchhikers who don't want to hitch
alone.

Hitchhiking enables the traveller, to have an eventful journey, to learn
more about our fellow human beings and many more things.
