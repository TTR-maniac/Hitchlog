Hitchhiking enables the traveller, to have an eventful journey, to learn
more about our fellow human beings and many more things.

# Vision

The hitchlog is a **social network for hitchhikers** which makes
information on previous hitchhiking experiences readily available.
To a person who has never hitchhiked before, hitchhiking might seem dangerous or
short-minded. The Hitchlog aims at changing this image by gathering data
of actual hitchhiking experiences which paints a real picture about what
Hitchhiking is actually like.
