    about:
      column1: |
        <span class="dropcap">H</span>itchhiking is quite an interesting
        way of traveling. <br/> The eventful journey, the encounter with
        many interesting and generous drivers and the experience of
        diversity in our society sets it apart from taking a train or
        driving by bus.<br/> It is more than just a way of getting from A
        to B.
      column2: |
        The Hitchlog gathers the stories and experience of hundreds of hitchhikers
        and puts them together with pictures, stories and data about the journey. <br/>
        It creates statistics for <b>one hitchhiker</b> as in having a profile with
        all the gathered data, as well as statistics for <b>all hitchhikers</b> as in
        what is the overall gender of all hitchhikers.
        This will paint a real, authentic picture about what Hitchhiking
        is actually like.
      column3: |
        A picture that is untouched of it's reputation spread by public media or movies.
        A picture which hopefully shows the world what a great way of travelling this is.
      intro: |
        The Hitchlog gives a real <i class="fa fa-photo"></i> on hitchhiking <br>
        We try to paint it with <i class="fa fa-heart-o"></i>
        and to give back to the <i class="fa fa-group"></i> who picked us up.
